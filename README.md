## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MongoDB instance running locally or in the cloud (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arulpathi/Job_Finder.git
   cd JobSeekerX
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Set up environment variables (create a .env file):

  - DATABASE_URL: MongoDB connection string
  - JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication

4. Run the backend (FastAPI):
   ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload

5. Open the frontend in a browser: Simply open the index.html file or serve it using a local server.

## Usage
- Job Seekers: Create an account, fill out your profile, and start searching for jobs. Receive personalized job recommendations based on your skills and preferences.
- Admins: Log into the admin portal to manage job listings, track user activities, and generate analytics reports.
  
## Machine Learning
- The platform uses a machine learning algorithm (collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) to recommend jobs.
- Future versions will include more advanced algorithms to increase the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

## Challenges and Future Work
Challenges:
- Data Quality: Ensuring a diverse and representative dataset for training the ML model.
- Model Interpretability: Balancing model complexity and making predictions transparent to users.

## Future Enhancements:
- Expand the dataset to improve job matching across different industries.
- Introduce more machine learning models to compare and optimize performance.
- Implement more robust features for the admin dashboard.
